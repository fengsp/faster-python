> Premature optimization is the root of all evil. &nbsp;&nbsp;----C.A.R.Hoare

##guide
* Never optimize before the program produces the desired results.
* Think twice if it is really worth before you make your code less readable for a speed gain. 
* Find out bottlenecks before doing anything.
* Do not optimize with bugs.
